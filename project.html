                        <b>Description</b>: This game was created by me and our entire year group totalling around 30 people.
                        The game consists of players fighting against other players to capture bases around the Island. These bases increase the teams total score which is used to win the game.
                        Players are these big mechs that are able to transform into a jet version to allow the players to fly around the map. As well as PVP the players have a team cash pool that players
                        can spend on base upgrades and AI units that can be ordered around to aid the players. Before the players spawn in they can select a class that will provide them with
                        weapons and abilities that can be used in engagements.

                        <b>Description</b>: This game was apart of the 2023 global game jam and the game was made by me and a small team.
                        The game is a generic tower defence game, the player has to protect their base from enemies by placing down towers that shoot
                        at the enemies. As the theme given was that of roots, we decided to add a intresting mechanic to the game. When a tower is placed town it spawns
                        turrets that are rooted to the built tower. because they are rooted togther if the tower is destroyed all the turrets linked to that tower will also be destroyed.

                        <b>Description</b>: This game was apart of a 2 other games that we were asked to do over my masters degree. We had to create 3 games that were at
                        diffrent stages of developement (Alpha, Beta, Gold) this game was our gold. The player is overseeing an island of people, the island population is split up
                        into diffrent classes. These classes provide resources that can be used by the player. During play the island is hit with diffrent natural disasters that the player will need
                        to prepare for, the player can see on the timeline an estimate of when these disasters will take place but they will not know the severity of these disasters.
                        at any point the player can manipulate the populations class gaining more of a particular resource, but doing so will change the populations awareness of the player.
                        If the awarness reaches max then the player is discovered and its game over. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the timeline with the most people alive.

                        <b>Description</b>: This game was one of the first games me and one other course mate began development on for our potential indie studio. The game is a battle royal
                        type game that includes mechs and melee comabat. When the game starts the player and AI is placed onto a circular platform that will shrink and fall apart over time.
                        The player will have to hit the AI robots off the platform in order to win else fall of themseleves. The game will feature a character customisation screen that will allow the
                        player to customise their mechs and create weapon classes. The game is PVE but the hope is to add multiplayer to reach out to a wider audiance.
